# Green-Doctor
This is a plant disease detecting app made with two of my peers while participating in during an ACM-Hackathon.
It requires the concept of Machine Learning , data set and android studio combined together, through this app we can capture or upload any plant disease 
and the app will be able to detect the disease and give certain solutions. It will be provided in many different languages too and we can even message the solution through sms portal and gain more knowledge reagrding the problem.
