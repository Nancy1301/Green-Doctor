This is a plant disease detecting app made with two of my peers while participating in during an ACM-Hackathon.
It requires the concept of Machine Learning , data set and android studio combined together, through this app we can capture or upload any plant disease 
and the app will be able to detect the disease and give certain solutions. It will be provided in many different languages too and we can even message the solution through sms portal and gain more knowledge reagrding the problem.

# About the Project:
1. It's a mobile application aimed at aiding approximately 500 farmers in identifying crop diseases efficiently and providing them with accessible and cost-effective solutions for treatment. The application was designed to be user-friendly, ensuring ease of use for farmers with varying levels of technological proficiency.

2. We employed advanced deep learning techniques to enhance the application's disease identification capabilities. This involved investigating and implementing various deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and transfer learning methods like VGG16 and ResNet. These models were trained using a dataset consisting of 32,000 images of crop diseases, leveraging libraries such as OpenCV and PyTorch for image classification tasks.

3. Achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 88.5% in disease identification by utilizing the ResNet model, we tried to demonstrate the effectiveness of the implemented deep learning techniques in accurately identifying crop diseases.

4. In the end, we deployed the mobile application using Android Studio, showcasing a seamless integration of technology and innovation. The deployment process ensured that the application was readily accessible to farmers on Android devices, thereby facilitating widespread adoption and usage.
